McDonald’s in 2009 spent $2.1 billion to remodel
many of its 32,000 restaurants and build new ones at
a more rapid pace than in recent years. This is in stark
contrast to most restaurant chains that are struggling
to survive, laying off employees, closing restaurants,
and reducing expansion plans. McDonald's restaurants
are in 120 countries. Going out to eat is one of the first
activities that customers cut in tough times. A rising
U.S. dollar is another external factor that hurts
McDonald’s. An internal weakness of McDonald’s is
that the firm now offers upscale coffee drinks like lattes
and cappuccinos in over 7,000 locations just as budget-
conscious consumers are cutting back on such extrava-
gances. About half of McDonald’s 31,000 locations are
outside the United States.
But McDonald’s top management team says every-
thing the firm does is for the long term. McDonald’s
for several years referred to their strategic plan as
“Plan to Win.” This strategy has been to increase sales
at existing locations by improving the menu, remodel-
ing dining rooms, extending hours, and adding
snacks. The company has avoided deep price cuts on
its menu items. McDonald’s was only one of three
large U.S. firms that saw its stock price rise in 2008
